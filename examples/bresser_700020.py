Example showing decoding of data packets from a Bresser 7000020 Weather Station using the CC1101

#### Packet Information (from https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/src/devices/nexus.c)###

Nexus sensor protocol with ID, temperature and optional humidity
also FreeTec (Pearl) NC-7345 sensors for FreeTec Weatherstation NC-7344,
also infactory/FreeTec (Pearl) NX-3980 sensors for infactory/FreeTec NX-3974 station,
also Solight TE82S sensors for Solight TE76/TE82/TE83/TE84 stations,
also TFA 30.3209.02 temperature/humidity sensor.

The sensor sends 36 bits 12 times,
the packets are ppm modulated (distance coding) with a pulse of ~500 us
followed by a short gap of ~1000 us for a 0 bit or a long ~2000 us gap for a
1 bit, the sync gap is ~4000 us.

The data is grouped in 9 nibbles:

    [id0] [id1] [flags] [temp0] [temp1] [temp2] [const] [humi0] [humi1]

- The 8-bit id changes when the battery is changed in the sensor.
- flags are 4 bits B 0 C C, where B is the battery status: 1=OK, 0=LOW
- and CC is the channel: 0=CH1, 1=CH2, 2=CH3
- temp is 12 bit signed scaled by 10
- const is always 1111 (0x0F)
- humidity is 8 bits
